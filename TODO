Masking
Namespacing
Proper templating (eg FASTA/FASTQ)
Test DB with this breaking case (so HSP are not selected via length but with score)
 >40-284-M37839.2 Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pMG230 beta-lactamase (MIR-1) gene, complete cds
 >M37839.2 Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pMG230 beta-lactamase (MIR-1) gene, complete cds

Camila's idea: Add special coding gap model: Penalize gaps which shift the reading frame heavily, 
but penalize gaps with 3nt, 6nt etc. which delete AAs less

Tests and so on for Kmers and INVALID_KMER (0, AAA..)

Tests for DB in general
Test ambig nucs in sequences and DB search (ignore kmer=0, AAA...)
Consistent code style
